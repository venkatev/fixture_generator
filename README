FixtureGenerator
================

Rails way of generating fixtures. Create your fixture records using active
record 'create' calls and convert them into yml files easily.

Example
=======

class MyFixtureGenerator < FixtureGenerator
  def populate
    # Create your records here and add them to the fixture set by calling
    # 'add_record(record_name, record_object)'. That's it!
  end
end

MyFixtureGenerator.generate
